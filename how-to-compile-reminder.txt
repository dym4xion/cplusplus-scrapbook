use g++ for compiling C++ programs

$ g++ -o hi hello.cpp
compiles a source file 'hello.cpp' to an executable 'hi'

run this executable using
$ ./hi

alternately, you can simply compile using
$ g++ program.cpp

which will create a default executable file 'a.out', that is run
$ ./a.out

you can simply type './<TAB>' 

don't forget: you have a bash function 'gpp' that take a .cpp file, compiles
it to the default 'a.out', and runs that.

to compile programs using multiple files do:
$ g++ file1.cpp file2.cpp
$ ./a.out

for when you get to working with larger progects it will probably be worthwhile
looking into using 'make' to compile programs.
